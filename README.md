**Because of *Apple's ~~idiotic~~ ideology of asking Safari Developers to pay $99* to distribute their extension for free, you are forced to go through all these steps. If anyone has an Apple Developer account, feel free to package this software**

*You will have to re-install everytime you close Safari* (unless someone packages it with their Apple Developer account into a .safariextz file)

Chrome and Firefox versions coming soon...(These will be fully packaged since *Google and Mozilla don't feel the need to charge their customers $99 to create a simple extension.* Minimal Installation.)
